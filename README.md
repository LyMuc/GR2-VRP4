# Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery.

### **Project overview** <br/>
To study, implement and analyze the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery. The goal is to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles visiting a set of locations which also involves collection and distribution of goods from these locations. The problem focuses on minimizing the cost of function for the vehicles (minimizing distance travelled).

### Key elements in the Project:
 - Implemented Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery with Saving-based algorithm and Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND)
 - Executable Code in PuLP and Gurobi which solves the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery.
 - Test results on Christofides-Eilon datasets (7 datasets)
 - Implement web app to visualize the routes and summarize the results in Excel format.

### Branch Structure
- GUROBI: using gurobipy to solve VRPSPD.
- Images: Image to visualize route using matplotlib
- Others: The inital implement of CVRP and VRPSPD
- Pulp: Implement 30% Saving + VND
- vrpspd-web: VRPSPD solver web app
- Saving_based_algo.ipynb: Completed saving-based algorithm with VND improvement.
- VRP_SPD_Gurobi.ipynb: Completed vrpspd solver by gurobipy
- SALS+VND.ipynb: Incompleted implementation of SALS with VND improvment.
